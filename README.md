The following are the sound examples of paper: **TransPlayer: Timbre Style Transfer with Flexible Timbre Control**

### One-to-one transfer
Here are examples of one-to-one transfer comparing to the [baseline GAN model](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/3897)  
We trained the baseline GAN model on **guitar** and **piano** data, and trained TransPlayer on all intruments' data. 
This experiments is meant to show that TransPlayer can produce one-to-one transfer results comparable to the baseline, while TransPlayer can apply to more flexible choices of transferring pairs.
#### From Piano to Guitar
Piano source:
<audio src="p2g_src.mp3" preload="none" controls loop> </audio>
Transferred by baseline:
<audio src="p2g_bl.mp3" preload="none" controls loop> </audio>
Transferred by TransPlayer:
<audio src="p2g_tp.mp3" preload="none" controls loop> </audio>
